- 👋 Hi, I’m @MoparCoder
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Automating aspects of my Trading in the financial markets. I am not considering 100% automation at this point in time (maybe some time in the future when there is further development in AI and my knowledge on the topic increases), more so to keep an eye on the activity across a minimum 140 charts and perform certain actions on my behalf. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to code algorithms for my trading platforms. Coding in Python and MQL4, looking to pick up C#. I have already created a handful of tools using Python and MQL4. I have quite a few ideas that come to mind which drives me to code further in these languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... with others over time, probably not at the moment, but as my setups go live, I may require additional hands to manage.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I am here
